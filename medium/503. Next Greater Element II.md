<https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/>

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [1,2,1]
    Output: [2,-1,2]
    Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
    The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
    The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
    
    
```C++
//84 ms	12.5 MB
vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int> &nums)
{
    if (nums.size() == 0)
        return nums;//减少8ms
    vector<int> ans;
    stack<int> s;
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> nextInt(n, -1);
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++)
    {
        int x = nums[i % n];
        while (!s.empty() && nums[s.top()] < x)
        {
            nextInt[s.top()] = x;
            s.pop();
        }
        if (i < n)
            s.push(i % n);//判断完当前数字直接跳到后一个，避免重复入栈。eg:{0, 1, 11, 1, 120, 111, 123, 1, -1, -100}
    }
    return nextInt;
}
```
